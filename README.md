This repository belongs to an online course called "Observability with Grafana, Prometheus and Loki". The code generates random data points for an imaginary company called ShoeHub. 

To access the metrics, run the application using the executable file that is relevant to your operating system (i.e., ShoeHubV2.exe in Windows). The application includes a built-in webserver, so once the application is run, you will see the address where you can see the metrics under /metrics endpoint.
